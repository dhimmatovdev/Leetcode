# Problem: Array Partition

The objective of this problem is to maximize the sum of the smaller numbers in pairs formed from a given array. To achieve this, we need to:
1. Sort the array.
2. Group the sorted numbers into pairs and sum up the smaller number in each pair.

Since we cannot use built-in sorting functions, we implement a **Bubble Sort** algorithm for sorting.

---

## Solution

### Step 1: Sorting the Array
We used the **Bubble Sort** algorithm to sort the array in ascending order. In Bubble Sort, adjacent elements are compared, and if they are out of order, their positions are swapped. This process is repeated until the array is fully sorted.

**Code for Sorting:**
```cpp
for (int i = 0; i < nums.size() - 1; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < nums.size() - i - 1; j++) {
        if (nums[j] > nums[j + 1]) {
            int temp = nums[j];
            nums[j] = nums[j + 1];
            nums[j + 1] = temp;
        }
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**
- The outer loop ensures that the sorting process runs `n-1` times, where `n` is the size of the array.
- The inner loop compares and swaps adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.
- This process "bubbles up" the largest element to its correct position at the end of the array.

---

### Step 2: Summing Up the Smaller Numbers in Each Pair
Once the array is sorted, we group elements into pairs `(nums[0], nums[1]), (nums[2], nums[3])`, etc., and sum up the first element of each pair.

**Code for Summing:**
```cpp
int sum = 0;
for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i += 2) {
    sum += nums[i];
}
```

**Explanation:**
- The loop increments by 2 to access the smaller number in each pair directly.
- These numbers are added to the variable `sum`.

---

### Step 3: Returning the Result
Finally, the sum of the smaller numbers in all pairs is returned as the result.

**Full Code:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int arrayPairSum(vector<int>& nums) {
        // Bubble Sort to sort the array or use sort function 
        //         sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());

        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size() - 1; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < nums.size() - i - 1; j++) {
                if (nums[j] > nums[j + 1]) {
                    int temp = nums[j];
                    nums[j] = nums[j + 1];
                    nums[j + 1] = temp;
                }
            }
        }
        
        // Summing the smaller numbers in each pair
        int sum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i += 2) {
            sum += nums[i];
        }
        return sum;
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution solution;

    // Example input
    vector<int> nums = {6, 2, 6, 5, 1, 2};

    // Output result
    cout << "Maximum Sum of Pairs: " << solution.arrayPairSum(nums) << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Example Walkthrough
Given the array `{6, 2, 6, 5, 1, 2}`:
1. After sorting: `{1, 2, 2, 5, 6, 6}`.
2. Pairing: `(1, 2), (2, 5), (6, 6)`.
3. Summing the smaller numbers: `1 + 2 + 6 = 9`.

The result is `9`.

## Key Points

1. **Why Bubble Sort?**
   We chose Bubble Sort as it’s easy to implement and demonstrates the sorting process clearly, even though it’s less efficient for larger arrays.

2. **Optimization Considerations:**
   - Bubble Sort has a time complexity of \(O(n^2)\). For larger inputs, we would use more efficient algorithms like Merge Sort or Quick Sort.
   - Space complexity is \(O(1)\) as sorting is done in place.

3. **Result Validation:**
   The sorted array ensures that pairing is optimal, and summing the smaller elements guarantees the maximum result.

This approach not only solves the problem but also gives an understanding of basic sorting algorithms and how they can be applied in practical scenarios.
