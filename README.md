## LeetCode Solutions Repository

Welcome to my LeetCode solutions repository! This repository contains my solutions to various LeetCode problems across different difficulty levels, including **Easy**, **Medium**, and **Hard**.

### Purpose
The main goal of this repository is to document my journey of solving LeetCode problems while improving my coding and problem-solving skills. It is also intended to help others who might be looking for different approaches or explanations to these problems.

### Features:
- Solutions written in multiple programming languages (e.g., Python, Java, C++).
- Problem classifications based on topics such as **Arrays**, **Linked Lists**, **Dynamic Programming**, **Graph Algorithms**, and **Strings**.
- Detailed comments explaining the approach, time complexity, and space complexity of each solution.

### How to use:
1. Browse through the directories or files based on the problem title or topic.
2. Each solution is accompanied by an explanation in the code comments, and many include references to the problem’s unique ID and title on LeetCode.
3. You can clone or fork this repository to follow along, suggest improvements, or contribute your own solutions.

### Contribution:
- If you'd like to contribute, feel free to submit a pull request with your solution.
- Contributions are welcomed for new problems, optimizations, or improvements in code quality.

### Technologies used:
- Programming Languages: **Python**, **Java**, **C++**, etc.
- Data Structures and Algorithms: Arrays, Linked Lists, Trees, Graphs, HashMaps, etc.
